                <h2>MONEY HEIST</h2>
                <p>A criminal mastermind who goes by "The Professor" has a plan to pull off the biggest heist in recorded history -- to print billions of euros in the Royal Mint of Spain. To help him carry out the ambitious plan, he recruits eight people with certain abilities and who have nothing to lose. The group of thieves take hostages to aid in their negotiations with the authorities, who strategize to come up with a way to capture The Professor. As more time elapses, the robbers prepare for a showdown with the police.

Trapped students must fight their way out — or turn into one of the rabid infected.Now, anyone can rightfully say that there is a surplus of zombie content out there to consume. There are several series and even more movies circling around this, each one a story of survival and ingenuity. But to them, we say: So what? As I heard just this afternoon, “We love the undead.” So here are my first impressions of the first episode of All Of Us Are Dead on Netflix.
