                <h2>TINOLANG MANOK</h2>
                <p>Tinolang Manok is a great tasting and healthy dish to prepare for your family. It is easy to cook and friendly on the budget. I like the idea of having tinolang manok at least once per week (particularly during cold weather) because it keeps me stay warm and  it is also one of my comfort foods.

                <h2>SINIGANG NA BABOY</h2>
                <p> Sinigang na baboy with Gabi is a Filipino pork soup with taro cooked in a sour broth. Sinigang is my comfort food, and one of the first few dishes that I tried to make way back when I was starting to learn how to cook.What’s not to love with pork sinigang, or the dish in general? I grew-up enjoying its many version and variation until today. There is something in this top Filipino food that makes people cook it again and again. I personally like how it makes me feel when sipping the hot sour broth. It gives me a feeling of comfort and warmth during cold weather. It also gives me the same relaxing feeling when I eat it during warm summer days, but the warm broth somewhat makes me feel cool literally, for some reason.

                <h2>CHICKEN CURRY</h2>
                <p> This Pinoy Chicken Curry recipe is the Filipino version of the popular chicken curry dish. It is delicious and easy to cook. The sauce is rich, creamy, and flavorful. It goes well with warm white rice.Other people refer to this as Filipino style chicken curry. This version is considered Filipino food. The ingredients used and not used in this recipe make this dish different from the traditional. Fish sauce, bell pepper, celery, and coconut milk or evaporated milk are some of the ingredients that can be found on Filipino chicken curry versions. Traditional chicken curry also has tomato, lemon juice, and yogurt, all of which are not utilized in this recipe.Filipino Chicken Curry usually uses bone-in chicken with skin on. I have been using this for my chicken curry as long as I can remember.

                <h2>SWEET AND SOUR FISH</h2>
                <p> Sweet and sour is a combination that originally came from Asia. Asian food, mostly of Chinese origin, adopted this blend. Based on articles, the Chinese (particularly the Cantonese) were the one’s who originally came up with the thought of mixing these two different flavors. This Sweet and Sour Tilapia Recipe is a good example of this. Sweet and sour fish can be prepared using either fish fillet or whole fish. Grouper (also known as lapu-lapu in the Philippines) is the type of fish commonly used to make this dish. I am using tilapia for this recipe because it is also reasonably priced and it can be easily sourced almost anywhere in the world.
