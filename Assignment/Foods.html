                <h2>TINOLANG MANOK</h2>
                <p>Tinolang Manok is a great tasting and healthy dish to prepare for your family. It is easy to cook and friendly on the budget. I like the idea of having tinolang manok at least once per week (particularly during cold weather) because it keeps me stay warm and  it is also one of my comfort foods.

                <h2>SINIGANG NA BABOY</h2>
                <p> Sinigang na baboy with Gabi is a Filipino pork soup with taro cooked in a sour broth. Sinigang is my comfort food, and one of the first few dishes that I tried to make way back when I was starting to learn how to cook.Whatâ€™s not to love with pork sinigang, or the dish in general? I grew-up enjoying its many version and variation until today. There is something in this top Filipino food that makes people cook it again and again. I personally like how it makes me feel when sipping the hot sour broth. It gives me a feeling of comfort and warmth during cold weather. It also gives me the same relaxing feeling when I eat it during warm summer days, but the warm broth somewhat makes me feel cool literally, for some reason.
