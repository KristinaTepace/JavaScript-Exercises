                <h2>TITANIC</h2>
                <p>James Cameron's "Titanic" is an epic, action-packed romance set against the ill-fated maiden voyage of the R.M.S. Titanic; the pride and joy of the White Star Line and, at the time, the largest moving object ever built. She was the most luxurious liner of her era -- the "ship of dreams" -- which ultimately carried over 1,500 people to their death in the ice cold waters of the North Atlantic in the early hours of April 15, 1912.

                <h2>SAW</h2>
                <p>The Saw franchise's villain was inspired by a serial tickler. Wan revealed that he was inspired by a real-life criminal case he heard about when he was 17. The case apparently involved a serial offender who broke into people's houses to tickle their children's feet, which made an impact on the "Saw" filmmaker.
