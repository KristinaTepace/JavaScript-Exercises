                <h2>SINGING</h2>
                <p>I grew up singing for fun around the house with no intention of taking it seriously. I learned early on that many people like to sing in the shower, in the car, with friends, and in churches, but most people wouldn't bother taking up singing as a real skill to develop into something that could make them a living. As I got more and more interested in singing, it became more than just a hobby. There are several places singing can take you if you let it. Here are just a few examples that I want to share my experience. When I started singing as a hobby in grade school, it was a great way for me to release the negative emotions I was going through during those awkward puberty years. I'd be getting teased at school or be left out from after-school hangouts with the cool kids and sadly make my way home alone to sing. It sounds like a boring life, but it actually got me through some pretty dark times. Singing releases endorphins into your brain that lift your spirits. It doesn't even matter if you're a good singer or not. The act of singing and really tapping into the passion you have for your favorite songs can help you feel emotionally lifted.
